# osCore2 Fork of the [Opensimulator](http://opensimulator.org) Project
## with support from Mobius Grid, and Stolen Ruby


### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

Minimal support is offered for this project at this time, it is a labor of love, and should be not used for production environments unless you are really sure what you are doing.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
This is our public version of Mobius. Features will be added here once they reach a relatively stable stage in their development.

Features will be developed on their own branches that are based on master until they are ready for beta. Small patches and changes will go straight to beta. The beta branch will always be up-to-date with master. Once the beta branch is stable it will be remerged into master. In short, master is the stable release, but beta will have more stuff.

## osCore2 .0.5 Alpha with DisplayName support.
### Release Notes supplied by Stolen Ruby
\+ New Region Restart Notification   
\+ LSLSyntax Module   
\+ ViewerAsset Module   
\+ External AvatarPickerSearch Handler   
\+ Port range settings on simulators   
\+ Option to have the region's port match the port of the sim   
\* Merge with osCore2 (2766eef)

 - The matching port setting will only work for one region per simulator.
 - A PHP handler for AvatarPickerSearch and ViewerAsset will be included in OSAWS.
 - I had to remove core's implementation of LSLSyntax and ViewerAsset.
 - The region restart plugin has been changed to take the amount of time until a restart instead of a list. The RemoteAdminPlugin has been changed to match this behaviour.
 - To make a region use the same port as the simulator, set its `InternalPort` to `MATCHING` in the ini.

\+ New ROBUST service to provide display names more efficiently  
\* `FetchDisplayNamesInterval` is now `DisplayNamesCacheExpirationInHours` with a default value of 12   
\* HG display name updates are now sorted by their home grid and a single request is made to each grid

 - Don't forget to add the HGDisplayNameServiceConnector to your ROBUST config so other grids can fetch your display names!

\+ Display Names  
\+ Option to hide the last name Resident  
\+ No last name login for users with the lastname Resident  

 - Only the MySQL parts of Display Names is coded so far.
 - The `CharSet=utf8mb4;` specified in the MySQL ConnectionStrings of UserAccountService and GridUserService is required.
 - Fetch Display Names still needs work as it's not grouping requests properly, and the timeout is far too big.
 - LSL Display Name functions have only been updated in YEngine.
 - Name Tags will appear to the user as they would appear on the user's home grid.
 - Trying out a thing where where HG usernames are displayed as `first.last@grid.url.com` instead of `first.last.@grid.url.com` for nametags. This doesn't affect how it is formatted in other places.
 - Also trying a thing where HG visitors will have their proper name as their display name if they don't already have a display name.
 - The 7 day wait for changing your display name is hardcoded at the moment as the viewer will always say 7 days.
 - Display names of HG visitors are updated when they arrive.

- [JOpenSim](http://jopensim.com) is included by default
- [phpmutelist](https://github.com/kcozens/OpenSimMutelist) is included by default
- YEngine (formerly XMR) is included and is the default script engine
- Bulletsim has been removed and UbODE is the default physics engine

# OpenSim Overview

OpenSim is a BSD Licensed Open Source project to develop a functioning
virtual worlds server platform capable of supporting multiple clients
and servers in a heterogeneous grid structure. OpenSim is written in
C#, and can run under Mono or the Microsoft .NET runtimes.

This is considered an alpha release.  Some stuff works, a lot doesn't.
If it breaks, you get to keep *both* pieces.

## Compiling OpenSim

Please see BUILDING.md if you downloaded a source distribution and
need to build OpenSim before running it.

## Running OpenSim on Windows

You will need .NET 4.6 installed to run this version OpenSimulator.

We recommend that you run OpenSim from a command prompt on Windows in order
to capture any errors.

To run OpenSim from a command prompt

 * cd to the bin/ directory where you unpacked OpenSim
 * run OpenSim.exe

Now see the "Configuring OpenSim" section

## Running OpenSim on Linux


You will need Mono >= 5.x to run this version of OpenSimulator.  On some Linux distributions you
may need to install additional packages.  See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Dependencies
for more information.

To run OpenSim, from the unpacked distribution type:

 * cd bin
 * mono OpenSim.exe

Now see the "Configuring OpenSim" section
### I'd suggest the following settings in your linux startup script for OpenSim.exe
> ulimit -s 1048576

> export MONO_GC_PARAMS="nursery-size=32m,promotion-age=14,minor=split,major=marksweep,no-lazy-sweep,alloc-ratio=50"

> export MONO_GC_DEBUG=""

> export MONO_ENV_OPTIONS="--desktop"


## Configuring OpenSim

When OpenSim starts for the first time, you will be prompted with a
series of questions that look something like:

        [09-17 03:54:40] DEFAULT REGION CONFIG: Simulator Name [OpenSim Test]:

For all the options except simulator name, you can safely hit enter to accept
the default if you want to connect using a client on the same machine or over
your local network.

You will then be asked "Do you wish to join an existing estate?".  If you're
starting OpenSim for the first time then answer no (which is the default) and
provide an estate name.

Shortly afterwards, you will then be asked to enter an estate owner first name,
last name, password and e-mail (which can be left blank).  Do not forget these
details, since initially only this account will be able to manage your region
in-world.  You can also use these details to perform your first login.

Once you are presented with a prompt that looks like:

        Region (My region name) #

You have successfully started OpenSim.

If you want to create another user account to login rather than the estate
account, then type "create user" on the OpenSim console and follow the prompts.

## Connecting to your OpenSim

By default your sim will be available for login on port 9000.  You can login by
adding -loginuri http://127.0.0.1:9000 to the command that starts Second Life
(e.g. in the Target: box of the client icon properties on Windows).  You can
also login using the network IP address of the machine running OpenSim (e.g.
http://192.168.1.2:9000)

To login, use the avatar details that you gave for your estate ownership or the
one you set up using the "create user" command.
